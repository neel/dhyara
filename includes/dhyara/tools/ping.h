/**
 * ping tool sends Echo requests in batches. Each batch contains <tt>batch</tt> number of requests. Number of batches is <tt>count</tt>. 
 * No explicit delay between two requests in the same batch. Sleep between two consecutive batches in <tt>sleep</tt> ms.
 * It reports the min, max, avg and total RTT (Round Trip Time) between the source and the target.
 * It also reports the total duration as half of the difference between the first sent time and last received time.
 * Following is an example of ping output. The target node's mac address is 4c:11:ae:9c:a6:85. tx/rx are the packets or bytes transmitted vs received.
 * In this example it took ms 12.7 for the last ECHOR to be received since the first ECHOQ was sent. 
 * According to this report 6.35 ms is the expected time, it may take for the target node to receive a 5000 byte long payload transmitted by the source node, in the current condition of wireless medium.
 * \code
 * I (41130) ping: 4c:11:ae:9c:a6:85
 * I (41140) ping: waiting 1s for all replies
 * I (42140) ping: 20/20 received, 0.00% lost, rtt min/avg/max/total = 1.07/1.24/1.78/24.85 ms
 * I (42140) ping: 5000/5000 bytes in 12.7 ms
 * \endcode
 * Following example demonstarate usage of ping tool.
 * \code
 * dhyara::address target("4c:11:ae:9c:a6:85")
 * dhyara::tools::ping ping(_network);
 * ping.count(50).batch(20).sleep(1);
